We need to decide whether we want to use a stripped-down AST (without tokens,
without location information, and with just the strict expression information),
or if we want to use Sam's austere AST (with all of the above).

To support "stars" (which will denote "holes" in expressions of where the
computation currently is), it seems we need a new tree.

But if we don't use the austere AST, we lose the existing pretty printer.
OK, so the existing pretty printer works solely by utilizing the existing
source, meaning that we can't use the original pretty printer anyways.

Seems to be little reason NOT to just translate to something new.
